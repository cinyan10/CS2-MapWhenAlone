# MapWhenAlone

A [CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) plugin that lets the **only player on the server** change maps with `!map`.

* Uses `cfg/GGMCmaps.json` (same format as [GG1MapChooser](https://github.com/ssypchenko/GG1MapChooser), but independent).
* Fuzzy matching (`!map jakke` → `kz_jakke`), shows suggestions if multiple.

## Usage

```
!map <name>
```
